"""
A showcase of Yukon as a differential drive rover.
It uses two Big Motor modules, one to control the left side motors,
and the other to control the right side motors.

There is a LED Strip module controlling left and right strips that represent
each side's speed as a colour from green -> blue -> red. Additionally, there is
a proto module wired up to a buzzer to alert the user to the battery voltage getting
too low, which also exposes the UART for connection to a bluetooth serial transceiver.

The program receives commands from the JoyBTCommander Android App and converts them to
motor speeds. it also sends the voltage, current, and temperature of Yukon back to the App.

Press "Boot/User" to exit the program, only if the buzzer is not sounding.
If the buzzer sounds, disconnect power as soon as possible!
